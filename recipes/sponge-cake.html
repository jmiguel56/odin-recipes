    <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons water</li>

    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

  <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat egg whites with the cream of tartar (if using) on high until it becomes foamy. Next, add ⅓ of the amount of sugar and beat on high until firm peaks form. When lifting the whisk, look for the tip to drop slightly. Set aside.
        ⅞ cup white sugar,6 eggs,½ teaspoon cream of tartar
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>In a large bowl, add the egg yolks, the remaining ⅔ sugar, salt, water, honey, and vanilla. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form when lifting the whisk. The ribbon should remain for 3 to 4 seconds. Add half the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and fold gently.

    </li>
    <br>

    <li>Make batter: Sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture in three parts, gently folding after each time. Next add the vegetable oil. Tip: To help incorporate the oil better, mix a few spoonfuls of the batter with the oil before adding.

    </li>
    <br>

    <li>Add the remaining ½ of the egg whites to the batter and fold gently until well combined, taking care not to deflate the batter.

    </li>
    <br>

    <li>Line two 6 inch cake pans with parchment paper along the sides and bottom. Pour the batter and bang the pan twice to remove large air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the crust is golden brown with a raised center, about 27 to 30 minutes. See Notes section for additional baking times.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>When the sauce starts bubbling, add broccoli. Stir to coat the broccoli in Sauce, then let it simmer for 1 minute or until Sauce is thickened.

    </li>
    <br>

    <li>Remove all the parchment paper and allow to cool completely on a cooling rack before slicing. Use a cake leveler for even slices. Serve with whipped cream and fruit or make a layered cake. Enjoy!
